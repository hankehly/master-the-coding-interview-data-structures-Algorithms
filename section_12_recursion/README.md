# Section 12: Algorithms: Recursion

With recursion, we aim to **divide problems into identical smaller sub-problems**, ie smaller instances of the same problem.

### Terms

Term | Meaning
:- | :-
Recursive Case | The case in a recursive function where you call the function again
Base Case | The case in a recursive function where you stop calling the function

Usually you have 2 returns â€“ one for the base case and one for the recursive case.

### When should we use recursion?

Anything you can do you recursion CAN also be done with a loop. So why use recursion?

You should consider resursion when..
* you can divide the problem into smaller but identical sub-problems (ie. smaller instances of the same problem)
* you *don't know how deep to go*.
* dealing with **trees**
* Divide and Conquer

Benefits of recursion:
* Recursion can improve readability
* Recursion can help you keep your code DRY.

Disadvantages:
* Large stack
* May be difficult to understand for less-experienced team members

### Figuring out the recursive case

When you're trying to figure out the recursive case, think about how you can divide the problem into sub-problems, ie. smaller instances of the same problem.

For example:
```
What's the value of f(5) ?
It's f(3) + f(4)                 # Dividing problem into smaller instances of the same problem
Okay, what's the value of f(4)?  # Ask the question repeatedly and it becomes apparent how the recursion should work
It's f(2) + f(3)
...
```

Continue until you reach low numbers (nearing the base case). It should become apparent that the answer to a certain prompt is always going to be a specific value, like 1 or something.

```
What's the value of f(2) ?
It's 1, always               # This is your base case (if n==1)
What's the value of f(1) ?
It's 0, always               # This can also be part of the base case (if n==0)
```
